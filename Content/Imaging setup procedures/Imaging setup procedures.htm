            <li class="li_1"><span class="span_1">Reduce cone error between the mount and the telescope. This is done by using the azimuth and latitude</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="ilad">adjusters</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">on the mount to first center Polaris in the polar</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><a href="http://www.astronomyforum.net/wiki/Scope" title="Scope"><span class="Hyperlink_1">scope</span></a><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">reticle. Then, once Polaris is</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">centered</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">in the polar scope, you can center Polaris side to side in your EP or Liveview by using the DEC slew buttons. You cannot center it vertically without shimming the front or rear of the ota.</span> <span class="span_1">Now Polaris is</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">centered</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">in the polar scope and in your EP/Live View hopefully</span></li>
            <li class="li_1">Using the manual adjusters, Set Polaris to the correct hour position displayed in the hand controller </li>
            <li class="li_1"><span class="span_1">Now reach around and shut the mount off. Now turn it back on. You have just established a base pointing model for the mount. Go back into the hand controller</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">menu, select 'Align' and then select 'One Star Align'. Choose a bright star that you can see easily (</span><a href="http://www.astronomyforum.net/wiki/Sirius" title="Sirius"><span class="Hyperlink_1">Sirius</span></a><span class="span_1">, Rigel, Altair, Kochab, etc) and then hit enter.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1"><span class="span_1">The mount will slew to the selected star. The hand controller will now ask you to center the star by using the slew buttons. It may not be in the field of view, no worries, it may take a 5 second slew at speed 5 in either right </span><span class="span_1">ascension</span><span class="span_1"> or left </span><span class="span_1">ascension</span><span class="span_1"> to bring the star into view.</span><span class="span_1"><br /></span><span class="span_1"><br /></span><span class="span_1">As soon as you have</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">centered</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">the alignment star, hit 'Enter' and then you can slew almost anywhere in the sky and have the target in the field of view. To center a subsequent target, just use the hand controller's 'Select and Synch' feature to center it.</span><span class="span_1"><br /></span><span class="span_1"><br /></span> <span class="span_2">Tip:</span><span class="span_1"> If your hand controller battery is weak, it will not</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="ilad">store</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">the correct date or time and it will default to 2011. If it does that, it's time to replace it.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_5"><span class="span_1"><br /></span><span class="span_2">Tip:</span><span class="span_1"> If you </span><span class="span_1">consistently</span><span class="span_1"> use the 'Select and Synch' feature, at the end of the night the mount will return to your zero marks, perfectly. If you just slew around to center the target, the mount will not return exactly to the zero marks. Not a big deal, just use the hand controller slew buttons to align your marks in RA and DEC, then shut the mount off.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_5"><span class="span_1"><br /></span><span class="span_2">Tip:</span><span class="span_1"> With the ZEQ25 and CEM60 mounts the polar scope view is available at all times. To check your</span><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><a href="http://www.astronomyforum.net/wiki/Polar-Alignment" title="Polar Alignment"><span class="Hyperlink_1">polar alignment</span></a><span class="span_1">&#160;</span><span class="span_1">during the night, just look through the polar scope. Note that the hour scale will have rotated, but Polaris should still be in the correct position on the radial circle. Ie; if your polar alignment was spot on, Polaris' movements will always be in a counter-clockwise rotation and will remain in the correct position on the degree/radial circle in the polar scope.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_5"><span class="span_1"><br /></span><span class="span_2">Tip:</span><span class="span_1"> If Polaris' position changes or moves away from the radial circle, it may be due to the polar scope axis not being aligned to the mount's axis. Refer to the iEQ45 User Manual for instructions on how to align the polar scope to the mount. The ZEQ25 polar scope cannot be aligned to the mount's axis by the user, the adjustments are buried within the mount housing. It can be done </span><span class="span_1">with an aftermarket polar scope spacer however.</span><span class="span_1"><br /></span>

        <p class="p_6">Notes:</p>
        <p class="p_5"><span class="span_3">go into the HC, and set the Guide Rate to 1.0. In PHD2, set your Calibration steps to 3000.</span><span class="span_3"><br /></span><span class="span_3"><br /></span><span class="span_3">At this setting PHD2 should calibrate in 5-6 iterations.</span><span class="span_2"><br /></span><span class="span_2"><br /></span>
